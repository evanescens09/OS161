# Question 1 #
#------------#
Strlen returns an unsigned integer, so the length of the empty string is 0
and 0 - 1 (line 12) results in an overflow, causing the loop to read far past 
the string causing a segmentation fault.

#------------#
# Question 2 #
#------------#
a) int **p; p is a pointer to a pointer to an int

b) int p; p is an integer

c) struct thread p; p is a struct

d) char *p; p is a pointer to a char

e) int*(int, char **); p is a pointer to a function that takes an int and a pointer to a pointer to a char

f) u_int16_t p; p is an unsigned short

g) int p; p is an int that is returned from printf

h) double p; comma operator evaluates first operand, discards, then evaluates second operand and returns 

i) u_int32_t p; p is an unsigned int

j) u_int32_t p; p is a pointer to an unsigned int


#------------#
# Question 3 #
#------------#
a) This macro performs bitwise & operator on a pointer and a STACK_MASK defined in an earlier macro.
It then checks for equality between the result of the bitwise & operation.

b) Macro concatenates syscall names with numbers by concatenating the two tokens before expanding the macro.

c) This macro defines _VOP, that evaluates its first operand, discards, then evaluates the second operand
and returns.  In this case, it evaluates the function vnode_check which takes a struct and a 'stringified'
char, and then evaluates and returns the vop_ concatenated with the stringified symbol. VOP_OPEN is defined
as calling _VOP on its arguments.
