CSCC69 Assignment 2
Assignment specification:
You will extend OS/161's thread system and will implement several system calls to allow OS/161 to support more interesting user programs. To complete this assignment, you will need to become familiar with the OS/161 thread code. (OS/161's threads are "processes".) The thread system provides interrupts, control functions, and semaphores. You will be extending the thread system to provide additional, higher-level functions found in most thread libraries and will use that functionality to implement the process management system calls getpid, waitpid, fork.
